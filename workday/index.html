    <h2>My Background</h2>

    <p>I grew up in Southeast Tennessee and live in Cincinnati. That means I have Southern charm and Midwestern grit. I’m a dad, an avid home coffee roaster, an ok guitar and banjo player, and I love a good trap beat. I use Oxford commas.</p>
    <p>I’ve been working with web and native applications for 13 years and have significant experience in branding, illustration, technical writing, and customer support.</p>

    <h2>Why I Want to Work at Workday</h2>

    <p>Word of mouth. I know some folks already working with the VNDLY teams and they have really nice things to say about the culture and work environment. Secondly, I like what I've read from the Workday design team on Medium. As someone who tends to be a "User Experience Team of One" at various consluting gigs, I'm excited to potentially be part of a growing, experienced, and thoughtful team. And of course, the Workday principal designer's job encompasses the things I'm the best at. It feels like the next step for my skillset and career.
