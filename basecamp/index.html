    <h1>
      Hey, Basecamp.
    </h1>

    <p class="large">I’m an experienced product designer who loves creating simple and thoughtful solutions with small teams.</p>
    <p class="large">I’m not a ninja or a rockstar. I do the work to make sure my users get things done. I state things plainly. I help my company flourish.</p>
  </section>

  <h2>My Background</h2>

  <p>I grew up in Southeast Tennessee and live in Cincinnati. That means I have Southern charm and Midwestern grit. I’m a dad, a small batch coffee roaster, and I fiddle with knobs to make music. I use Oxford commas.</p>
  <p>I’ve been working with web and native applications for 15 years and have experience in branding, illustration, technical writing, and customer service.</p>

  <h2>Why I Want to Work at Basecamp</h2>

  <p>First, I use and love Basecamp’s products. I started with Basecamp Classic way back in 2009 and use Basecamp Personal for freelance projects today. I admire the progress and product decisions I’ve seen firsthand.</p>
  <p>I've read or re-read <em>Rework</em>, <em>Remote</em>, <em>It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work</em>, and <em>Shape Up</em>. I AM ON BOARD. Your outlook aligns with how I see design, strategy, product development, and work life.</p>
  <p>There’s not a better team in the business. You’ve got intelligent designers, programmers, support staff, podcasters, and leadership. I'll add the benefit of my broad experience while learning from some of the best in the biz.</p>
  <p>Finally, your benefits are incredible. Everyone knows that. It's clear that you value and trust your employees.</p>

  <h2>What I've Done</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>I led design for an app helping travel nurses find new assignments and complete complex credentialing processes.</li>
    <li>I helped Untappd — a popular craft beer focused app — evolve from a beloved side project to over 8 million users creating an incredibly passionate and active user base.</li>
    <li>I led design for two industry pioneering B2B web applications allowing restaurants, bars, and bottle shops to meaningfully connect to their customers and streamline their distributor ordering process.</li>
    <li>I worked closely with developers and scientists to design an app that recommends wine and beer based on user profiles and mass spectrometry. We even reached #2 in the app store’s Food & Wine category — bested only by mighty Taco Bell. Live Mas.</li>
    <li>I collaborated with a small development team to design and develop features for regional grocery chains like IGA, Tops, Mollie Stone’s, and Fresh Thyme.</li>
  </ul>

        <p>Together Ryan and I conducted user interviews to help shape the functionality of a product that took on digitizing a very analog workflow and he never failed to be able to translate their needs into intuitive and clever design. It was my first professional opportunity to work closely with a member of a design team, and he set an amazing example of what cross functional collaboration should look like.</p>
