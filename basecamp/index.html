      Hey, Basecamp.
    </h1>
    
    <p class="large">I'd like to join your team.</p>
    <p class="large">I’m an experienced product designer who loves creating simple and thoughtful solutions with small teams.</p>
    <p class="large">I’m not a ninja or a rockstar. I do the work to make sure my users get things done. I state things plainly. I help my company and their products flourish.</p>

    <h2>My Background</h2>

    <p>I grew up in Southeast Tennessee and live in Cincinnati. That means I have Southern charm and Midwestern grit. I’m a dad, an avid home coffee roaster, an ok guitar and banjo player, and I love a good trap beat. I use Oxford commas.</p>
    <p>I’ve been working with web and native applications for 13 years and have significant experience in branding, illustration, technical writing, and customer support.</p>

    <h2>Why I Want to Work at Basecamp</h2>

    <p>First, I use and love Basecamp’s products. I started with Basecamp Classic way back in 2008 and use Basecamp Personal for freelance projects today. I admire the product decisions and progress I’ve experienced firsthand.</p>
    <p>I've read or re-read <em>Rework</em>, <em>Remote</em>, <em>It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work</em>, and <em>Shape Up</em>. I AM ON BOARD. Your philosophies closely align with how I've come to view design, product development, and work life.</p>
    <p>I've learned so much over the years from intelligent and forward-thinking Basecamp designers, programmers, support staff, and your excellent podcast. Shout out to Wailin and Shaun.
    <p>I'll add my ability to reframe complex problems and solve them with simple, intuitive interfaces while continuing to learn from some of the best in the business.</p>
    <p>Finally, your benefits are incredible. It's clear that you value and trust your employees – I want some of that.</p>
